# Deep-Stereo-Vision-for-Nighttime-Driving-Scenes
Deep Stereo Vision for nighttime driving scenes

This project aims to apply deep stereo vision techniques to accurately localise objects in the surrounding environment and optimise the illumination conditions. Additionally, the project has a target to test various lighting conditions to determine the optimal setup for achieving the best object localisation performance in different environments.

## Hypothesis 
A deep learning approach, specifically designed and trained on synthetic data generated in Unreal Engine 5, will generate depth maps with good accuracy and speed for object localisation in nighttime driving scenes.
